Protocol
========

**TODO:** Add warning about this document being a _"living document"_

This document aims to document the entirety of the DNET protocol, otherwise known as _Dante_. It must
be noted that this document is a **living document** meaning that it is nowhere near complete and much
of the content on this page is subject to changes - this notice will be removed and versioning information
will become available as soon as the protocol reaches a stable state.

Please note that you are currently viewing the protocol specification for Dante-2, if you were looking
for the specification of thr now-defunct Dante-1 then please go [here](d1/protocol.md).

Dante-2 uses [ProtocolBuffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) to encode the parts of the messages that make-up one whole message, in other
words how the message is _encoded_.
